= Paneron website common components

This library exports:

- UI constants, some React components and global style rules
  (to ensure consistent styling across Paneron presentational websites)
- Functions encapsulating react-static site configuration and initialization logic
  (to reduce boilerplate code among said websites)

Websites using this library are assumed to be built with react-static and Emotion.

For an example, see link:https://github.com/paneron/extensions.paneron.org[extensions.paneron.org codebase].
